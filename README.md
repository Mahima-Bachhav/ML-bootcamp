# ML Bootcamp

This repository contains a collection of **hands-on Machine Learning projects and notebooks** developed as part of a structured ML bootcamp. The focus of this bootcamp is to build a **strong foundation in core machine learning algorithms**, emphasizing both **from-scratch implementations** and practical experimentation.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside

This bootcamp covers fundamental machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression** – Predicting continuous values using ordinary least squares  
- **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification from scratch  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Distance-based classification  
- **K-Means Clustering** – Unsupervised learning for grouping data  
- **Neural Networks** – Basic multi-layer perceptron implementation  
- **Polynomial Regression** – Modeling non-linear relationships  

Each notebook walks through:
- Data loading and exploration  
- Preprocessing and feature handling  
- Model implementation  
- Training, evaluation, and visualization

## ⭐ Key Highlights & Achievements

- Built and evaluated core machine learning models **from scratch**  
  (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural Networks) using only **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

- Achieved **98% accuracy** and **95% F1-score** on hidden test datasets through effective training and evaluation strategies.

- Analyzed **decision boundaries** and **model errors** to identify limitations, improve robustness, and ensure reliable model performance.
